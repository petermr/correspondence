# correspondence
Public correspondence with journals, politicians, etc.

## about
Correspondence of public interest, especially about copyright and publishing. My contributions are CC BY. The other authors hold copyright in theirs. I assert public interest, fair use for my reproduction of them.

I am experimenting with this instead of my blog (which is hosted by University of Cambridge and increasingly unsuitable).
